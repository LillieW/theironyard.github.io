            ul
              li <strong>Thinking over syntax</strong> <br><em>We believe syntax is the easy part of programming and that we are successful when we’ve helped someone learn to think like an engineer.</em>
              li <strong>Quality over quantity</strong> <br><em>We’re interested in training true professionals, not getting as many people into our classes as possible.</em>
              li <strong>Real projects over scripted assignments</strong> <br><em>People learn programming best by tackling hard problems with a mentor, not following a list of steps and taking a quiz.</em>
              li <strong>Instructors as practitioners</strong> <br><em>Our teachers stay sharp by taking time off in between classes to freelance, build products and run companies, ensuring the latest, greatest curriculum every semester. </em>
              li <strong>Emphasis on open source</strong> <br><em>We deeply value the open source mindset and intentionally create and contribute to open source projects.</em>

        h2 <a name="kids"></a> Free Code Education for Kids
        p At each of our locations we offer free code classes for kids. We believe in investing in the local tech economy for the long-run, and that means impacting the next generation. 
        p Students in our intensive courses are required to volunteer, teach and run our kids programs as a part of their involvement in the Academy. (Not only does this develop a giving mindset, but it helps them communicate things they've learned—an essential skill as they grow into management positions in their careers.)
